I am reading the book How Smart Machines Think by Sean Gerrish. In one chapter, he explains the Deep Dream Generator. 
It was very popular in 2015, and I used it a lot to make my pictures look dreamy. Thanks to Clade, I can now understand 
the logic behind it. Here is a notebook that explains it better.
