[Read the full version on Medium](https://medium.com/@balci.pelin/quantization-2-7398a0ce7584) Understanding quantization can feel like learning two different languages when comparing TensorFlow and PyTorch. In this 
post, I’ll guide you through the differences and similarities, providing clear explanations along the way. You can find 
all the code references and notes in the provided [notebook](https://github.com/pelinbalci/LLM_Notebooks/blob/main/Quantization.ipynb)
