# Machine Learning Fundamentals

**This article is generated by Claude Opus 4.5**

## Overview

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed, these systems improve their performance through experience.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning enables computers to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario. It's the foundation of many modern AI applications, from recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles.

### Key Concepts

- **Training Data**: Historical data used to teach the model
- **Features**: Input variables used to make predictions
- **Labels**: The output we want to predict (in supervised learning)
- **Model**: The mathematical representation of patterns in data

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning

The algorithm learns from labeled training data, making predictions based on that data.

**Examples:**
- Classification (spam detection, image recognition)
- Regression (price prediction, weather forecasting)

```python
# Simple supervised learning example with sklearn
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Training data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])

# Create and train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make prediction
prediction = model.predict([[6]])
print(f"Prediction for 6: {prediction[0]}")  # Output: ~12
```

### 2. Unsupervised Learning

The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data.

**Examples:**
- Clustering (customer segmentation)
- Dimensionality reduction (data compression)
- Anomaly detection

### 3. Reinforcement Learning

The algorithm learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties.

**Examples:**
- Game playing (AlphaGo, Chess engines)
- Robotics
- Resource optimization

## Common Algorithms

### Linear Regression
Predicts continuous values based on linear relationships.

### Logistic Regression
Classification algorithm for binary outcomes.

### Decision Trees
Tree-like model for classification and regression.

### Neural Networks
Inspired by biological neurons, forms the basis of deep learning.

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Finds optimal boundaries between classes.

### K-Means Clustering
Groups similar data points together.

## The ML Workflow

1. **Problem Definition**: What are we trying to predict or understand?
2. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features
5. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate algorithm
6. **Training**: Teach the model with training data
7. **Evaluation**: Test model performance
8. **Deployment**: Use the model in production
9. **Monitoring**: Track performance over time

## Practical Example: Predicting House Prices

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'size': [1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900],
    'bedrooms': [3, 3, 4, 4, 5],
    'age': [10, 15, 20, 5, 8],
    'price': [300000, 320000, 340000, 380000, 400000]
})

# Prepare features and target
X = data[['size', 'bedrooms', 'age']]
y = data['price']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
```
