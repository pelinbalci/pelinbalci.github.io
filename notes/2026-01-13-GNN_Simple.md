description: "This notebook is a learning journey from traditional collaborative filtering to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for recommendation systems."

"In this series, I'll build a graph neural network for movie recommendation, starting from the fundamentals and working 
up to a functional implementation. Along the way, we'll see how GNNs differ from traditional matrix factorization and 
where they might shine."
