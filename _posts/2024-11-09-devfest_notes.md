I've joined GDG devfest'24 event yesterday. There were remarkable speakers. I would like to add my notes.
You may find the link of the conference [here](https://devfest.istanbul/)

### Devops MLOps LLMOps

I've combined the presentation notes and get a little help from chatgpt to prepare this chart. It shows the differences
between Devops, MLOps and LLMOps Practices. The presentations are: 

- From Devops to MLOps fro Majd Jamaah - Beyond Limits, GDE
- From Ideation to production: GENAI Application  Development and LLMOps from Emrah Mete - Microsoft
