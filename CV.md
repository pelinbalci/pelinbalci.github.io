## Work Experiences
- 2022 -  SabancıDx, Sr. Data Scientist 
    - Demand prediction for retail company 
       - The aim of this project is to predict the demand from sub-parties and turn the prediction into order amount 
         according to the lead time and safety stocks
       - My responsibilities are reframing the project scope, detailing the tasks, making code reviews, turning the 
         initial codes into production

- 2020 - 2022 SabancıDX, Data Scientist
    - Prediction of breakage in a production
        - The aim of this project is to recommend parameters which minimizes the breakage in the final product for 
          industry
        - Data: Customer’s own dataset
        - Model: XGBoost and Linear Regression
        - The project includes the maintenance of the codes and create an MLOPs platform to schedule retraining and 
          making faster analysis.
    - IOT Project: Air Quality IOT Product 
      - Building an IOT Product which measures the quality of data for offices. 
      - I’ve checked the measurements with Power BI & Python
    - Prediction of System Direction for an Energy Company
      - The aim of this project is predicting the hourly energy imbalance direction for the upcoming day.
      - Data: Public dataset from “EPIAS Seffaflık Platform”
      - Model: Neural Network Model is implemented with PyTorch 
      - Deployment: Databricks. Our model is being retrained every week and send a prediction mail to custome
      - Tools: Python, Databricks, SQL, Power BI
    - Delivery Optimization for a Fast-Food Company 
      - The aim of this project is improving delivery process and optimize shifts 
      - Data: Customer’s own data. 
      - Simulation for delivery process: I’ve written Simulation environment with Simpy which shows the order’s 
        assignments and delivery times. Simulation is used to show the current state and the improvement of our new 
        approach before live test. 
      - Shift optimization: Targeted hourly driver numbers are calculated based on order distributions. 
        The working hours of full and part-time employees are determined by the Gurobi optimization tool based on the 
        targeted numbers. The objective function of the mathematical model is minimizing the difference between 
        the target driver and the assigned driver. These new shifts found as a result of the study are tested by 
        simulation and the delivery times that occur with the new shifts are checked. 
      - Tools: Python, SQL, Gurobi, Simpy, Power BI
