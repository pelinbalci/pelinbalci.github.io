# Pelin Balci, Msc Industrial Engineer

## About
I hold a master's degree in industrial engineering and have a professional background in this field. My postgraduate 
education was completed at Bilkent University, one of the tops institution in industrial engineering in Turkey. 
In addition to my academic qualifications, I have supplemented my expertise by taking several online courses in machine 
learning and deep learning.

At present, I am working as a Senior Data Scientist at SabancıDx. My research interests are focused on Tiny ML and 
Natural Language Processing (NLP). These are particularly dynamic areas of study, and I am passionate about advancing my 
understanding of them.

I am using Python as my primary programming language for my various projects. Additionally, I strive to enhance my coding 
skills by utilizing LeetCode. My objective is to make meaningful contributions to the data science community in Turkey. 
Recently, I joined AYA (Açık Yazılım Ağı), an organization committed to helping those impacted by the devastating 
earthquake in Kahramanmaraş.  I have worked as a lead on data labeling for NER and Intent Classification Models. 
I am also a member of the Geeks of Data community, which offers a valuable platform for sharing my knowledge and learning 
from the experiences of others.

As a self-learner, I firmly believe in the importance of open-source software. I embrace this philosophy by sharing my 
codes on GitHub and publishing posts on my website and Medium. If you have any questions about my projects or wish to 
engage in an open-source initiative, please do not hesitate to contact me :)

## Work Experiences
- 2022 -  SabancıDx, Sr. Data Scientist 
    - NLP - OCR Project
    - Air Handling Unit Optimization with Reinforcement Learning
    - Demand prediction for retail company 
       - The aim of this project is to predict the demand from sub-parties and turn the prediction into order amount 
         according to the lead time and safety stocks
       - My responsibilities are re-framing the project scope, detailing the tasks, making code reviews, turning the 
         initial codes into production

- 2020 - 2022 SabancıDX, Data Scientist
    - Prediction of breakage in the production
        - The aim of this project is to recommend sensor values which minimizes the breakage in the final product for 
          industry. XGBoost Regression is used to make break prediction, a recommendation system is implemented which 
          suggests the best sensor values in the factory.
        - Model: XGBoost and Linear Regression
    - IOT Project: Air Quality IOT Product 
      - Building an IOT Product which measures the quality of data for offices. 
      - Controlling the measurements with Power BI & Python
    - Prediction of System Direction for an Energy Company
      - The aim of this project is predicting the hourly energy imbalance direction for the upcoming day.
      - Model: Neural Network Model is implemented with PyTorch 
      - Deployment: Databricks. Our model is being retrained every week and send a prediction mail to custome
      - Tools: Python, Databricks, SQL, Power BI
    - Delivery Optimization for a Fast-Food Company 
      - The aim of this project is improving delivery process and optimize shifts
      - Simulation for delivery process: I’ve written Simulation environment with Simpy library which shows the order’s 
        assignments and delivery times. Simulation is used to show the current state and the improvement of our new 
        approach before live test. 
      - Shift optimization: Targeted hourly driver numbers are calculated based on order distributions. The working 
        hours of full and part-time employees are determined by a mathematical model based on the targeted employees. 
        The objective function is minimizing the difference between the target driver and the assigned driver. 
        Simulation environment is used to analyze the proposed number of employees.
      - Tools: Python, SQL, Gurobi, Simpy, Power BI
