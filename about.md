Hello! :)

I am an industrial engineer with a master’s degree. I'm working as AI/ML Engineer in SabancıDx. 
My job is also my hobby, I continue to write code in my spare time. At the moment, my biggest field of interest is 
LLMs. I care about sustainable environments and energy-efficient products. Here you can find my notes and projects 
for machine learning and deep learning.
